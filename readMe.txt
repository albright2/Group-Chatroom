Developed by: Jeremiah Albright

Requirements:
	Java JDK12 package may be required to run application

How to run:

- a server must already be running before client, to do so run "server.bat"
- next, run the client.bat file, enter a single token/string for your user name at login
	

-note:  This edition of the application runs the server and client to be hard-coded off of your pc's local host ipaddress.
        Therefore, the user can have multiple clients running on one server, all of which is on a single pc.
	Next update will include interconnectivity with other pcs, outside of one's network.
	
	
	It is possible to manually connect to another pc's server by:
	
	1) delete line 51 of Client.java
	2) type the ip address of server and its port in client.run
